    <h1>Privacy Policy for TodoX App</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: March 30, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>Thank you for choosing the TodoX App ("App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your data when you use our App. By using the App, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The TodoX App is designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information</strong>: We do not collect any personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, or phone number) unless you explicitly provide it (e.g., in a todo description). Any personal information you enter into the App (e.g., task names, descriptions) is stored locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Task Data</strong>: The App stores the following data related to your tasks:
            <ul>
                <li>Task name</li>
                <li>Task description</li>
                <li>Creation date and time</li>
                <li>Task type (e.g., Grocery, Work, Personal)</li>
                <li>Task status (Pending, In Progress, Completed)</li>
                <li>Reminder time (if set)</li>
            </ul>
            This data is stored locally on your device using a local database (SQLite) and is not transmitted to any external servers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Permissions</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: We request permission to send notifications for task reminders.</li>
                <li><strong>Alarms</strong>: On Android, we request permission to schedule exact alarms for reminders.</li>
                <li><strong>Battery Optimization</strong>: We may request to be exempt from battery optimization to ensure reminders work reliably.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: We do not collect any usage data, analytics, or device information (e.g., IP address, device ID) as the App operates entirely offline.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information we collect is used solely to provide the functionality of the App:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Task Management</strong>: Your task data (name, description, etc.) is used to display and manage your todos within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Reminders</strong>: The reminder time you set is used to schedule notifications and alarms to remind you of your tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: All task data is stored locally on your device to ensure persistence across app restarts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or transfer your data to any third parties, as the App operates offline and does not connect to external servers.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: All task data is stored locally on your device using SQLite, a secure local database. We do not store your data on any external servers or cloud services.</li>
        <li><strong>Security</strong>: Since the App operates offline, your data remains on your device and is as secure as your device itself. However, we recommend securing your device with a passcode or biometric authentication to protect your data from unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Retention</strong>: Your task data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App. Uninstalling the App will remove all task data stored in the local database.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The TodoX App does not use any third-party services that collect or process your data. All features (e.g., notifications, alarms) are implemented using native platform APIs (e.g., Android AlarmManager, Flutter Local Notifications).</p>

    <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Access</strong>: Since all data is stored locally, you have full control over your task data. You can view, edit, or delete tasks directly within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Permissions</strong>: You can manage the App’s permissions (e.g., notifications, alarms) through your device’s settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Deletion</strong>: To delete all task data, you can uninstall the App, which will remove the local database.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The TodoX App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information through the App, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
